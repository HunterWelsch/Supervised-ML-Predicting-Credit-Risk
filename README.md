# Overview 
Evaluated several machine learning models to assess credit risk, using data from a peer-to-peer lending service company.

The largest challenge when building this model was the unbalanced classes, the number of good loans heavily outnumber the number of risky or bad loans. This problem was solved with resmapling and the use of Imbalance-learn library.
